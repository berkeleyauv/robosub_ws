# sub-controls
The code for the the control system for our autonomous sub. 

# Installation
To actually install the code, you need to have Python 2.7 and ROS Kinetic installed. We run this on our NVIDIA Jetson TX1. Then you must do `pip install -e controls/` which will install our `robosub` module.

# Running
Call `python robosub/sub_init.py` which will open up a REPL loop. Read its documentation to learn more.
